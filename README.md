# jamulus server utilities 
A few short scripts and systemd files I use to configure and run various server configurations including a Central server with clients.  
  
  jamulus.pl will start n servers from a list of names
  jamulus_central.pl also starts a central server
  users.pl parses the log files for usage by date and time of day
  locate.py outputs a list of locations from ip addresses that can be added to a map
